# Sugar drink consumption in EU

**About the project** 
---------------
The Python code takes the tsv file containing data on sugar drink consumption in EU, cleans data, and visualizes data for 3 countries and EU27 average.
Data visualizations include total data by country, data by age, education and gender.
By default the 3 countries are Latvia, Lithiania and Estonia, however by making a quick adjustment in the main.py code, it will work for any 3 countries represented in the tsv file.

P.S. This is my very first project in Python. :)

**Installation and Usage**
----------------
* File requirements.txt includes list of packages used in this project
* Data file is included in the repo
* Use explore_data.py to get data overview and country codes to be used in the main.py (if you want to explore countries other than the ones already provided in the main.py)
* Use main.py to visualize data and change countries to be included in the charts.
